Design and build a fully animated, interactive front-end UI for a developer portfolio. The interface should visually represent a programmer‚Äôs digital workspace, combining realism, futuristic style, and immersive animations. The theme is dark, tech-savvy, and alive ‚Äî representing the creative, intelligent environment of a full-stack developer.

‚ú® UI Design Requirements
Theme: Modern developer environment

Dark mode by default

Neon accents (cyan, purple, or deep blue)

Subtle matrix-like digital particles or data streams in the background

Use high-performance GPU-friendly animation libraries (GSAP, Framer Motion)

3D Elements (React Three Fiber):

Floating code editors

Terminal windows that animate open/close

Coffee mug with rising steam

A glowing keyboard with keystroke animation on hover

Dual-monitor desk setup in 3D, with project screens the user can interact with

Interactive Mouse Behaviors:

Cursor highlights or ‚Äúmagnetizes‚Äù objects on hover

Mouse movement shifts lighting, camera parallax, and depth (e.g., head tracking style)

Cursor-following glow trail or ripple pulse effect

Animations:

Smooth page transitions with fade and slide

On-scroll reveal of code snippets or tool icons (GSAP timeline triggers)

Hover effects that simulate tool feedback (e.g., keyboard clicks, folder opening)

Developer Tools UI Elements:

A floating toolbar showing icons: VS Code, GitHub, Terminal, Browser, React, Laravel

Each icon opens an animated floating window with live content when clicked

Code files float and scroll in 3D space, fading in/out with context

Animated terminal logs showing "building project..." or real-time typing simulation

Voice AI Integration Placeholder (Agent Blank):

Reserved space or animated hologram area for Agent Blank avatar

Subtle pulsing ring or waveform when she‚Äôs listening or speaking

Interactive UI lighting responds when the assistant is active

üßë‚Äçüíª Vibe & Branding
Make the user feel like they're stepping into Israel Opoku‚Äôs personal coding lab

Blend realism (keyboard, code) with imaginative elements (floating holograms, intelligent UI)

Keep everything interactive, reactive, and intuitive ‚Äî no static sections or boring cards

Prioritize developer personality, mastery, and futuristic presence
