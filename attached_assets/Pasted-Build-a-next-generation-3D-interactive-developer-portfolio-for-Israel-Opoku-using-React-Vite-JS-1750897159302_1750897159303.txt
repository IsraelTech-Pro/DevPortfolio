Build a next-generation 3D interactive developer portfolio for Israel Opoku, using React + Vite + JSX, with full cinematic animations, immersive UI, dynamic 3D environments, and a custom AI chatbot agent trained on Israel's biography, skills, and story.

The experience should feel like a playable, immersive game website — with fluid navigation, device showcases, real-time interactions, and a deeply humanized AI companion that tells Israel’s story, interacts with visitors, and explains the work.

🎮 Hero Scene: "The Dev Awakens"
Fullscreen WebGL/Three.js 3D environment with animated floating islands or a virtual dev workspace (React Three Fiber).

Animated floating 3D code blocks, devices, and screens rotating gently.

Centerpiece: A futuristic robot avatar or hologram that speaks:

"Hello, visitor. I am Opoku-1, a sentient AI crafted by Israel Opoku, a master of React and PHP. I exist because of him."

Bot begins by introducing Israel and inviting interaction:
“Ask me about the creator, his projects, or how he brought me to life.”

👤 Israel's Digital Identity
Create a floating holographic profile card with Israel’s avatar.

Animate his name as liquid/glitch/techno morph typography.
